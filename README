The sample code for accessing the beaglebone's hardware 


### ccs_bare_gcc_arm_asm_serial

Print hello arm on the serial 
### ccs_bone_leds
Binary clock on the 4 leds of the beagle

### ccs_bone_mmc
Read and write to the MMC

### ccs_bone_uart
Sample "C" program to print to the UART


## The future

Idealy I would like to merge this code with the turorial found here
http://www.bravegnu.org/gnu-eprog/ to have a nice little standalone
turorial for developing arm using the the beaglebone as example.


You can also have a look at
* StarterWare:http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/StarterWare  (TI licensed can only use on their hardware)
* u-boot (GPL)  If you like that
* Linux If you just want things to work
